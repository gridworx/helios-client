# Proposal: Add User UX Improvements (Phase 3 & 4)

## Goal
Finish the implementation of the "Add User" experience improvements. Phase 1 & 2 (Quick Add Slideout foundation) are complete. This proposal covers Phase 3 (Add User Page improvements), Phase 4 (License Support), and refinements to the Sideout.

## Scope
1.  **Refine QuickAddUserSlideOut**: Convert Job Title/Manager to dropdowns.
2.  **Improve Add User Page**: Fix alignment and add provider checkboxes.
3.  **License API**: Backend support for listing and assigning licenses.

## Impact
-   Reduces data entry errors (Job Title consistency).
-   Improves "Add User" page usability.
-   Enables selling/assigning licenses during creation.

## Risks
-   Low. Isolated to User Creation flows.
