Go to Settings > Organization\n2. Scroll to 'Organization Domains' section\n3. Add domains using the form\n4. Remove alias domains (primary cannot be removed)\n\n**Automatic Features**:\n- Initial domains are seeded from existing user emails\n- When domains are added, users are automatically reclassified\n- When domains are removed, affected users become guests\n\n**Use Cases**:\n- Company with multiple brands/domains\n- Merger/acquisition with new domains\n- Distinguish internal staff from external guests",
